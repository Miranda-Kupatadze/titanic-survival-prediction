This document outlines the specific tasks completed for the Data Science Final Project.

## Team Member: Miranda Kupatadze
**Role: Data Scientist & Project Manager**

### Tasks Completed:
* **Data Processing & Cleaning:** * Performed initial data inspection and identified missing values in 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns.
    * Implemented a Random Forest Regressor pipeline to predict and fill missing age values based on passenger features.
    * Handled categorical encoding for 'Sex' and 'Embarked' variables.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Conducted statistical analysis to identify survival correlations.
    * Created 5+ visualizations using Seaborn/Matplotlib, including survival heatmaps and class-based distribution plots.
* **Machine Learning Implementation:**
    * Developed the baseline Logistic Regression model.
    * Implemented and tuned the advanced XGBoost classifier, achieving a final test accuracy of 83.2%.
    * Generated the final `submission_xgboost.csv` output.
* **Documentation & GitHub Management:**
    * Organized the repository into the required `data/`, `notebooks/`, and `reports/` structure.
    * Authored the `README.md`, `.gitignore`, and `requirements.txt` files.
    * Managed version control and created the `v1.0-final` release tag.
