# Titanic Survival Prediction - Data Science Final Project

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. By analyzing historical passenger data, we identify key factors such as socio-economic status, age, and gender that influenced survival rates. This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.
